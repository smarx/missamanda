      <title>Freedom of Choice</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom of choice is one of the key components of the Montessori classroom. People who are unfamiliar with Montessori may hear that phrase and think that there isn’t discipline, that the children can do anything that they want. That is far from accurate. The distinction is that the children are free to make a choice from a &lt;em&gt;prepared environment&lt;/em&gt; that the teacher has set up and free to choose from a select group of lessons that the teacher feels the child is ready for. The teacher carefully observes
the child and assesses which activities are appropriate and will benefit the
child’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child enters the classroom, they are encouraged to choose work that they have had a lesson on, or they may ask for a new lesson. In my classroom, the children work independently for the first two hours of the day. If a child is engaged and concentrating, we do not interrupt. The child may repeat the activity as many
times as they would like. They cannot misuse the materials, but they can experiment and explore with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a child is not able to engage with any activity, if they are wandering around or prefer socializing, I will often give them two choices. “Would you like to work at a
table or a carpet?” “Would you like to work with sounds or numbers?” “Would you like to do this apple counting activity or this frog counting activity?” Each time I am offering the child a choice, but I am only offering choices that I want the child to do. Sometimes a child will say, “I was just about to choose ___.” My answer is often either “That sounds fun, will you show it to me when you are done?” or “That sounds like a great idea. When you are done doing (an activity that I want them to do) can I do that with you?” Even when I want the child to do one particular lesson or task, I still offer them a choice. “Would you like to read these words with me before snack or after snack?” Giving the child a choice gives them a sense of power and ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child who makes their own choices is more likely to repeat the work, focus for an extended period of time, and feel a sense of pride and personal fulfillment. They are able to work at their own pace and on things that are interesting to them. Children
who are making choices and are engaged are not disturbing the work of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher observes which activities are most popular. Why are they loved by the children? How can they replicate that interest in other activities? The teacher knows each child’s interests and can tailor activities to a particular child. If a student loves
dinosaurs, for example, the teacher can set up dinosaur matching cards, dino color sorting, or an activity to build a dinosaur with tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children may also choose to work alone or with a friend. Children in my classroom know which activities are for one person or two people. If a child wants to work with a friend, they will choose a “two-person work” and invite a friend to join them. The teacher determines which activities are for two people and which are for one person. Many of the more advanced math and language work is designed for two children.
The most popular activities in my classroom are the 100 board, the 45 layout, and reading action words. These are all two-person activities and require more than just mastery of numbers and letters; they also require teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your home, freedom of choice can be achieved without it being a free-for-all. This begins by limiting choices. Ask your child if they want an apple or banana for snack. Do they want to play outside with sidewalk chalk or a ball? Do they want to build with Legos or Lincoln Logs? Sometimes a child is overwhelmed by too many choices. Help them. Offer your child authentic choices. Make sure the options are appropriate and things you can do. Respect their choices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Practical Life</title>

    &lt;img src=&#34;https://missamanda.blog/Practical%20Life/PL%20objectives.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://missamanda.blog/lesson-plans/practical-life/&#34;&gt;The lessons in Practical Life&lt;/a&gt; are the foundation of Montessori education. As students practice in the Practical Life area of the classroom, they are developing the aptitudes for order, concentration, and coordination. At the same time, by caring for their own needs, the classroom environment, and helping others, children in a Montessori program develop independence, self-confidence, and self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical Life is the heart of my classroom. The student’s first lessons take place in this area, and frequently, it is the first work many children choose when they come into the classroom each day. Children are drawn to the Practical Life area time and again because of the beauty and familiarity of the materials found there. They are often materials found in the child’s home and can help give the child a feeling of security. Many of the materials are objects they will be working with and manipulating into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://missamanda.blog/Practical%20Life/PL1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physically, Practical Life helps to develop muscle control and coordination. This includes hand-eye coordination, practice with a three-finger “pencil” grip, and manipulation of tools such as screwdrivers, clothespins, scissors, and zippers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning cannot take place without concentration and attention. Work in Practical Life is designed to promote and lengthen a child’s concentration and ability to pay attention to detail. Lessons progress from simple to complex. In Practical Life a child may pour water from one glass to another, button a shirt, sweep the floor, wash dishes, polish silver, build a model airplane, or sew a running stitch. Each activity increases their attention span, works to perfect their fine-motor control, and the children love it. As Maria Montessori said, “The child who concentrates is immensely happy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://missamanda.blog/Practical%20Life/PL3.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher’s role is to prepare the environment, model appropriate behavior, and observe the child. The teacher begins each lesson by inviting the child to work. The teacher models each step and movement with grace and precision. The teacher then
returns the work to its original location and tells the child they may now choose to do that activity (or work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Practical Life area includes work to care for the classroom environment and the classroom community in which children belong. This work develops skills used
to take care of their community and one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Montessori classroom children are respected and empowered as individuals. This leads to a strong push for independence. We want to help each child to grow emotionally as well as physically. Through repeated work and success in the Practical Life area, children become confident in themselves and in their abilities, leading
to a positive self-image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://missamanda.blog/Practical%20Life/PL2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400px&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grace and courtesy lessons are also included in the Practical Life curriculum. These lessons include modeling polite ways to interrupt, coughing into your sleeve, greeting
a person, and conflict resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next week, I will be putting more &lt;a href=&#34;https://missamanda.blog/lesson-plans/practical-life/&#34;&gt;Practical Life lessons&lt;/a&gt; online. These are things you can do at home with your children. You do not have to follow the lesson plan precisely. Please, adapt the lessons and find what works best for your environment and for your child. Remember that the primary goals are order, concentration, coordination, and independence. Your child will make a mess. That is okay! If a child spends five minutes washing dishes and the next five minutes mopping up the puddle on the floor, they spent ten minutes concentrating. Often when a child finishes a big job like that I&amp;rsquo;ll ask (with a big smile), &amp;ldquo;Are you feeling happy that you did that all by yourself?&amp;rdquo;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think you are feeling proud.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Role of the Teacher</title>
      <link>https://missamanda.blog/blog/role-of-the-teacher/</link>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maria Montessori wrote that, “In brief, the teacher’s principle duty in the school may be described as follows: She should explain the use of the material. She is the main
connecting link between the material, that is, the objects, and the child. This is a simple, modest duty&amp;hellip;” Maria Montessori believed that the role of the teacher was to have a strong knowledge of the material, maintain order in the classroom for the child, act as a “guardian angel” of minds to allow the child to work in peace, and to observe and give lessons as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been the lead teacher in a Montessori Early Childhood classroom for the past 11 years.  I became passionate about the Montessori Method because it so closely resembles my own philosophy of education. My vision of education is one of discovery, of making learning a hands-on interactive process. I am not the kind of person who can memorize or recite facts. I need to see, touch, smell, and fully experience a concept before I can learn. Education, in my mind, does not require a “teacher”, but rather a desire to learn. My belief has always been that the role of a teacher in education is to facilitate learning. The teacher must make available the things a child needs, make learning a positive experience, and nurture the development of a life-long love of learning. A teacher is not a fount of knowledge, but instead develops problem solving skills by saying, “I don’t know. How do you think we could find the answer?” A teacher truly knows the child, can engage the child with things that interest him or her, and can assess their readiness for new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, I have been trying to think of ways to support families who are now trying to educate their young children at home.  Right now many of you are the teacher in your child&amp;rsquo;s life. This can seem overwhelming, but hopefully learning more about Montessori education can help prepare you to be your child&amp;rsquo;s guide. My hope is that this blog helps to answer some questions, offers support, and provides resources and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montessori says to the teacher, “The secret of good teaching is to regard the child’s intelligence as a fertile field in which seeds may be sown, to grow under the heat of flaming imagination.  Our aim therefore is not merely to make the child understand, and still less to force him to memorize, but so to touch his imagination as to enthuse him to his inmost core.”&lt;/p&gt;
