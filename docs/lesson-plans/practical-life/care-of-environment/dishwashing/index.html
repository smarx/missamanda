<h2 id="comments">Comments:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In my classroom, children wash dishes after they eat snack.  The dishpans are already filled with water and the children do not need to fill or empty the dishpans after each use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your child is learning to use the toilet, please encourage them to go before putting their hands in the water.</p>
</li>
