Freedom of choice is one of the key components of the Montessori classroom. People who are unfamiliar with Montessori may hear that phrase and think that there isn’t discipline, that the children can do anything that they want. That is far from accurate. The distinction is that the children are free to make a choice from a *prepared environment* that the teacher has set up and free to choose from a select group of lessons that the teacher feels the child is ready for. The teacher carefully observes
the child and assesses which activities are appropriate and will benefit the
child’s development.

When a child enters the classroom, they are encouraged to choose work that they have had a lesson on, or they may ask for a new lesson. In my classroom, the children work independently for the first two hours of the day. If a child is engaged and concentrating, we do not interrupt. The child may repeat the activity as many
times as they would like. They cannot misuse the materials, but they can experiment and explore with them. 

If a child is not able to engage with any activity, if they are wandering around or prefer socializing, I will often give them two choices. “Would you like to work at a
table or a carpet?” “Would you like to work with sounds or numbers?” “Would you like to do this apple counting activity or this frog counting activity?” Each time I am offering the child a choice, but I am only offering choices that I want the child to do. Sometimes a child will say, “I was just about to choose ___.” My answer is often either “That sounds fun, will you show it to me when you are done?” or “That sounds like a great idea. When you are done doing (an activity that I want them to do) can I do that with you?” Even when I want the child to do one particular lesson or task, I still offer them a choice. “Would you like to read these words with me before snack or after snack?” Giving the child a choice gives them a sense of power and ownership.

A child who makes their own choices is more likely to repeat the work, focus for an extended period of time, and feel a sense of pride and personal fulfillment. They are able to work at their own pace and on things that are interesting to them. Children
who are making choices and are engaged are not disturbing the work of others.

The teacher observes which activities are most popular. Why are they loved by the children? How can they replicate that interest in other activities? The teacher knows each child’s interests and can tailor activities to a particular child. If a student loves
dinosaurs, for example, the teacher can set up dinosaur matching cards, dino color sorting, or an activity to build a dinosaur with tools.

Children may also choose to work alone or with a friend. Children in my classroom know which activities are for one person or two people. If a child wants to work with a friend, they will choose a “two-person work” and invite a friend to join them. The teacher determines which activities are for two people and which are for one person. Many of the more advanced math and language work is designed for two children.
The most popular activities in my classroom are the 100 board, the 45 layout, and reading action words. These are all two-person activities and require more than just mastery of numbers and letters; they also require teamwork.

In your home, freedom of choice can be achieved without it being a free-for-all. This begins by limiting choices. Ask your child if they want an apple or banana for snack. Do they want to play outside with sidewalk chalk or a ball? Do they want to build with Legos or Lincoln Logs? Sometimes a child is overwhelmed by too many choices. Help them. Offer your child authentic choices. Make sure the options are appropriate and things you can do. Respect their choices.
