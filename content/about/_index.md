Hi!  I'm Amanda Marx.  My students call me Miss Amanda.

I've been the lead teacher in a Montessori 3-6 classroom for the past 11 years.   I am a certified Elementary Education teacher, have two teaching certificates (K-6 and Nursery/Kindergarten), and trained as an Early Childhood Montessori Teacher through a MACTE certified AMS training program.

I'm also a mom.  I have two children who are independent teenagers. When they were younger I loved to implement Montessori methods at home.

I am creating this page to be a resource to both parents and teachers.  I welcome comments and would love to hear ways to make this site more user friendly.  You can contact me at MissAmandaRA@gmail.com.
