## Materials:

Scissor, paper, tray

## Presentation 1: (without paper)

1. Invite the child to a lesson on manipulating scissors.
2. Carry tray with scissors to table.
3. With subdominant hand, pick up scissors by the closed blades.  Thumb hole should be at the top.  Larger hole for fingers should be at the bottom.
4. Place thumb of dominant hand in hole on top.  
5. Place third finger of dominant hand in bottom hole.
6. Use index finger of dominant hand as a guide.
7. Using exaggerated motions show how extension of fingers opens scissors, always keeping the thumb on top.
8. Repeat opening and closing of scissors slowly and deliberately 3 or 4 times.
9. Still holding scissors with dominant hand, place back on tray.  Subdominant hand can be used to stabilize scissors or tray if needed.

## Presentation 2: (with paper)

Same as above, but add thin strips of unlined paper for the child to snip.

1. When scissors are held properly in the dominant hand and the scissors are opened, place a thin piece of unlined paper between the blades.  
2. Close the blades and watch as the paper is cut and a portion falls onto the tray.
3. When complete the child may keep or discard the paper cuttings.  
4. Return the scissors to the tray and carry appropriately to the shelf.

## Points of Interest:

Shape and feel of the scissors, sounds of the blades opening and closing, watching the paper fall, repeating this activity.

## Control of Error:

- Inability to cut paper, torn paper, paper on the floor, putting fingers in the wrong holes, turning hand so that thumb is not on top, using scissors on inappropriate materials.

## Language:

- scissors, open, close, snip, cut, squeeze, thumb, fingers, top, bottom

## Variations:

Using various colors and types of scissors, using patterned scissors, using a whole hand to squeeze scissors, using a hole punch, using various colored and patterned paper to cut.

## Extensions:

Using scissors to cut paper, thread, flower stems, or other materials when doing a variety of activities, using scissors to open items on the snack table.

## Comments:

- I highly recommend Fiskars scissors.
