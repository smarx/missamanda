## Materials:

One small tray, three small pitchers, enough liquid to fill each small pitcher 3/4 full, a medium sized pitcher that will hold all of the liquid indicated above, sponge, table

## Presentation:

1. Invite the child to a lesson on pouring.

2. Walk with the child to the shelf where the material is kept.

3. Slide the tray gently from the shelf using two hands (thumbs on top, fingers on the bottom).

4. Holding tray at waist level, elbows close to the body, carry tray slowly to the table.

5. Set tray down gently with medium sized pitcher containing water on the right side.

6. Pull out chair, sit down, adjust chair appropriately.

7. Look at material with hands on lap.

8. Extend 3 fingers of dominant hand, grasp handle with three-finger grip.

9. Support spout with subdominant hand, lift, move towards the empty pitcher on the top-left of the tray. Tilt and pour slowly and carefully.  Fill 3/4 of the way full.

10. Hold the pitcher for a moment, let the drops drip out.

11. Straighten pitcher, move to position, and set down gently, look into empty pitcher.

12. Grasp sponge with three finger grip of subdominant hand, wipe spout from bottom up.

13. Repeat steps 8-12 for the middle and bottom pitchers in that order.  

14. Each smaller pitcher should now be 3/4 of the way full and the medium sized pitcher should be empty.

15. Using the sponge, wipe up any spills on the tray, and return sponge to middle of tray.

16. Grasp both sides of tray with three-finger-grasp and turn tray clockwise 180 degrees using two movements.

17. Look at material. 

18. Begin with the top pitcher and repeat steps 8-12 (pouring the full contents) for each small pitcher to refill larger pitcher.  

19. Using the sponge, wipe up any spills on the tray, and return sponge to middle of tray.

20. Grasp both sides of tray with three-finger-grasp and turn tray clockwise 180 degrees using two movements.

21. Feel free to repeat multiple times if desired.

22. Push out chair, stand up, push in chair.

23. Grasp tray with both hands, lift from table, raise to waist level and carry slowly to the shelf.

24. Slide tray into position on the shelf.

## Points of Interest:

The color of the water, the appearance of the materials, the sound of water pouring, carrying the tray, seeing the sponge absorb water, and watching the last drops fall from the spout.

## Control of Error:

- Seeing the tray tilt, seeing pitchers move on the tray, seeing water in the small pitcher overflow, seeing water on table, tray, or floor, hearing clink of two pitchers hitting each other, seeing water left in the pitcher, pouring material is of contrasting color to the tray, using clear pitchers for visual control, water is pre-measured so small pitchers will fill equally.

## Language:

- Tray, pitcher, spout, handle, water, empty, full, spill, pour, sponge

## Variations:

Use glass pitchers, use pitchers of different shapes and volumes, and use colored water.

## Extensions:

Pouring water 1:4 or more, using a funnel, using a teapot with lid and teacups, using a variety of pitchers with and without handles, pouring drinks at the snack table.

## Comments:

Make necessary adjustments for a left-handed child. Start with water on the left.
