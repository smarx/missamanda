## Materials:

Plastic dropper, two small containers (container on the left contains water 3/4 full), small tray with rim, small sponge, table

## Presentation:

1. Obtain materials in the accepted manner.  Take them to a table.  Sit at the table.

2. Extend three fingers of dominant hand.  Pick up dropper by the bulb.

3. Move the dropper toward the container with water.

4. Lower it into the container.

5. Squeeze bulb slowly.  Watch as bubbles rise out of the water.

6. Release.  Watch as the pipette fills with water.

7. Lift slowly.  Watch and wait for drops to stop.  

8. Move towards the other container.  

9. Hold dropper over the container.  Squeeze the bulb slowly until the dropper is empty.  

10. Continue steps 3-9 until all of the water from the left-hand container has been transferred to the other container.

11. Place dropper on the table.

12. With three fingers of dominant hand, pick up sponge.

13. Dab up any spills.  

14. Hold the empty container in your subdominant hand.  Using a circular motion, wipe the empty container.

15. Squeeze sponge into full container.

16. Place sponge on tray between the two containers.  

17. Grasp the sides of the tray with two hands.  Using two movements, turn the tray clockwise 180 degrees. 

18. Replace dropper on tray.

19. If desired repeat the activity.

20. Return material in the accepted manner.

## Points of Interest:

The appearance of the materials, color and texture of materials, water, squeezing the bulb of the dropper, watching the bubbles, seeing the pipette fill with water, watching the water pour into the other container, using a sponge, and repeating the activity.

## Control of Error:

- Seeing the tray tilt and containers slide, seeing water on the tray or table, use of colored water and a clear dropper for visual control.

## Language:

Dropper, squeeze, release, empty, full, wipe, pipette, bulb

## Variations:

Using colored water, using a variety of containers, using test tubes, using one glass and one pitcher.

## Extensions:

Dropping liquid into suction cups, using a baster, using a dropper to measure liquid, polishing work, color mixing work, art and science activities, cooking experiences, dispense liquid soap for bubble making.

## Comments:

- As a first lesson, I would ensure that the containers are extremely small.  As always, test the material before the children use it.  You should be able to transfer all of the liquid from the first container in 5 or fewer full droppers.
