## Points of Interest:

The appearance of the materials (color and texture), squeezing the tongs, hearing the objects drop into the container, observing the empty container becoming full, and turning the tray.

## Control of Error:

- Objects for transferring are of a contrasting color to the tray and tongs, seeing the tray tilt and the containers slide on the tray, seeing objects that have fallen onto the table or tray, the ease or rigidity of the tongs.

## Language:

- Tongs, dropper, huller, squeeze release, names of objects used in exercise

## Variations:

Using different containers, using different sized beads, shells, pasta, beans, rocks, etc., using different kinds of tong like tools: tweezers, hullers, toast tongs, ice tongs, etc.

## Extensions:

Design a sorting activity that uses tongs or tweezers to move the objects, eating snack with "training" chopsticks.
