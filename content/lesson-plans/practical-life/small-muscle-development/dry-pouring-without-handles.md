## Materials:

One small tray, two matched tumblers without handles (equal in volume), enough beans to fill one tumbler 3/4 full, table

## Presentation:

1. Invite the child to a lesson on pouring.

2. Walk with the child to the shelf where the material is kept.

3. Slide the tray gently from the shelf using two hands (thumbs on top, fingers on the bottom).

4. Holding tray at waist level, elbows close to the body, carry tray slowly to the table.

5. Set tray down gently with tumbler containing beans on the right side.

6. Pull out chair, sit down, adjust chair appropriately.

7. Look at material with hands on lap.  

8. Stretch out hand, grasp tumbler, lift, and move toward empty tumbler.

9. Tilt and pour slowly into empty tumbler.  Watch beans as they fall.

10. When empty, straighten tumbler, move back, look into tumbler.

11. Lower gently, place on tray, remove hand.

12. Pick up any spilled beans one at a time using three fingers of dominant hand and place each bean into filled tumbler.

13. Look at material.

14. Grasp both sides of tray with three-finger-grasp and turn tray clockwise 180 degrees using two movements.

15. Look at material.  Repeat steps 8-14. It is advised to repeat at least one time, but feel free to repeat multiple times if desired.  

16. Push out chair, stand up, push in chair.

17. Grasp tray with both hands, lift from table, raise to waist level and carry slowly to the shelf.

18. Slide tray into position on the shelf.

## Points of Interest:

Appearance of materials, color and texture of beans, grasping the tumbler, pouring beans slowly into the center, hearing beans fall into tumbler, seeing one tumbler become full as the other empties, turning the tray.

## Control of Error:

- Seeing the tray tilt, seeing tumblers move on the tray, seeing beans on table, tray, or floor, hearing clink of two tumblers hitting each other, pouring material is of contrasting color to the tray

## Language:

- Tray, tumbler, glass, beans, empty, full, spill, pour

## Variations:

Use different contents for pouring - macaroni, peas, corn, beads, etc., use different tumblers of different texture and color, use opaque vessels

## Extensions:

Use a funnel, strainer, baster, or pour from a large container into a smaller one.

## Comments:

If possible, tumblers should be a matched set.  Beans or other materials used for pouring should be pleasing to the eye and of contrasting color to the tumblers or tray.

Make necessary adjustments for a left-handed child.  Start with material on the left.
