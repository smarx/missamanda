6. Pull out chair, sit down, adjust chair appropriately.

8. Stretch out hand, grasp tumbler, lift, and move toward empty tumbler.

9. Tilt and pour slowly into empty tumbler. Watch beans as they fall.

10. When empty, straighten tumbler, move back, look into tumbler.

11. Lower gently, place on tray, remove hand.

12. Pick up any spilled beans one at a time using three fingers of dominant hand and place each bean into filled tumbler.

## Points of Interest:

The appearance of the material, color and texture of material being poured, feel of the tumbler, pouring beans slowly into the center, hearing beans fall into pitcher, seeing as the pitcher becomes full and the tumbler become empty, turning the tray, repeating the activity, seeing the spout on the pitcher, seeing and grasping the pitcher by the handle.

## Control of Error:

- Seeing the tray tilt, seeing the tumbler and pitcher move on the tray, seeing beans on tray, table, or floor, hearing a clink sound when tumbler and pitcher touch, seeing and feeling pitcher wobble when lifting and pouring, tumbler and pitcher hold equal amounts, pouring material is a contrasting color to the tray and table.

## Language:

- Tray, tumbler, beans, empty, full, spill, pour, pitcher, spout, handle

## Variations:

Using different contents for pouring, using a variety of different textured and colored tumblers and/or pitchers.

## Extensions:

Pouring from one larger vessel to two smaller ones, using a funnel or strainer, spooning and pouring, pouring with water, pouring from a larger container to a smaller one, pouring a drink on the snack table, handwashing lesson

## Comments:

If possible pitcher and tumbler should match. 

Material being poured should be appealing and of contrasting color to the tray.

Make necessary adjustments for left-handed child.

When grasping the handle, slightly exaggerate the three-finger grasp.
