title: Practical Life
---

The work in Practical Life is the foundation of Montessori education. As students practice with Practical Life work, they are developing the aptitudes for order, concentration, and coordination. At the same time, by caring for their own needs, the classroom environment, and helping others, children in a Montessori program develop independence, self-confidence, and self-respect.
