## Points of Interest:

Appearance of materials, color, and texture, repeating the activity as long as needed, smelling the polish, seeing the difference between the polished and unpolished areas, seeing and feeling the polish applied in a circular motion, watching the polish dry, replacing polish cloth and Q-Tip.

## Control of Error:

- Seeing polish left on the mirror, seeing large amount of polish left in the dish, seeing polish on the mat, polishing dish is small and holds a limited amount of polish.

## Language:

- polish, mirror, sponge, apron, polishing, shine, polish dish

## Variations:

Polishing glass, silver, brass, copper, wood, or leather, using a small sponge instead of a Q-Tip, polishing more involved pieces (my students LOVE polishing a menorah), or polishing furniture. 

## Extensions:  {{< figure src="/Practical Life/eyeglass polishing.jpg" caption="polishing glasses" width="200px" class="right " >}}

Eye glass polishing, shoe polishing, leaf polishing, window washing, or washing the outside glass of an aquarium.

## Comments:

<u>Polish for Glass-</u> 1part vinegar, 6 parts water

<u>Polish for Wood - </u> 3 parts lemon juice, 1 part olive or flaxseed oil (shake well)

<u>Polish for Silver- </u> Toothpaste with baking soda base or mix baking soda with water to form a paste

<u>Polish for Brass or Copper - </u> 2 tablespoons of salt, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of vinegar (Combine the ingredients, adding enough vinegar and lemon juice to produce a thick paste.  Rub on with a Q-Tip. Rinse with water and polish with a clean, soft cloth.)

<u>Polish for Leather - </u> 1 tablespoon of beeswax, 1/2 cup of flaxseed oil (Combine ingredients in a small pan and heat slowly until the beeswax has melted.  Pour the mixture into a heat resistant container to let cool.  Once the polish has solidified, it will be like thin Vaseline.)
