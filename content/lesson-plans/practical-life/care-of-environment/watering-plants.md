## Points of Interest:

Beauty of the watering can, size of the watering can, choosing a plant to water, feeling the soil, tilting the can, seeing and hearing water pour into the plant.

## Control of Error:

- Only fill watering can with the amount of water that one plant will need, seeing water spill, seeing soil spill, and feeling the soil.

## Language:

## Variations:

If the plant is small, the child can carry the plant to their table and return the plant to its original location when they are done watering.  

## Extensions:

After plant is watered, a small flag that says, "I've been watered" can be placed in the plant so that plants will not be overwatered.
